# HYD Backend

This backend server is for the HYD (How's Your Day) mobile app. While the original concept is not mine, I am creating my own version to practice and refine my skills in the tech stack. The backend manages user data, daily routines, emotional tracking, activities, and connects users with trusted individuals.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for building the API.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing user data and app information.
- **React Native:** Mobile app frontend (for reference).

## Purpose

This project focuses on practicing backend development, specifically using **MongoDB** for flexible data management, and **Node.js** with **Express.js** to create scalable and efficient APIs. It allows me to gain hands-on experience with fullstack development, emphasizing the integration of NoSQL databases with backend logic for mobile applications.
